About:

This project takes a movie file (mp4, mkv, etc.) and compresses each scene into one pixel, and
aligning them side by side to create a 'Movie Barcode', creating a colourful and unique image.

Inspiration for making this project was through Reddit. A little while ago I was browsing through Reddit and saw a very interesting picture. After scrolling through the comments I found out what the picture was, it was a movie condensed into one image.

I decided it was something within my range of ability although could pose difficulty.

While making this project I learned about OpenCV, image and video manipulation, optimization,
multiprocessing & multithreading and more.

As one of my first invidual projects I have definitely learned a lot and am excited to do more.
