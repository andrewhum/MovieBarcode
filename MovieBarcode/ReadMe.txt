About:

This project takes a movie file (mp4, mkv, etc.) and compresses each scene into one pixel, and
aligning them side by side to create a 'Movie Barcode', creating a colourful and unique image.

While making this project I learned about OpenCV, image and video manipulation, optimization,
modularity and more.

As one of my first invidual projects I have definitely learned a lot and am excited to do more.
